# GithubTiles
1 year ago, 12 months after I joined Github, I used to wonder about people’s contributions in open source. Github shows the summary of contributions of a user in tabular tiles on the profile page of the user. The most active user on GitHub is Fabien Potencier (https://github.com/fabpot), According to http://git.io/top on Tue, 06 Dec 2016 17:06:46 GMT. His Github tiles look like this:

So fascinating!!. And Here’s mine:

Well, Yesterday, I came to know about ‘git commit --date DATE -m “Commit Message” ’ from https://codewithhugo.com/change-the-date-of-a-git-commit/. I got an idea to customise the tiles using a script so now I can travel back to the past, make changes, commit, push and then come back to present in just command. Oh yeah!!

I wrote a script that makes commits in past. I added some features like you can write your own text in your GitHub tiles using the script, or turn all grey tiles to green. Do you also want to try this? So here’s the procedure...
Just create a temporary repository from your account, paste link in the script, and tell script, what to write on your wall. The script will change a file by replacing its content with random content and committing them. You can further make this repository private to hide the fake commits from the world.

I know it’s all fake, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t have fun with this. Impress people, prank your colleagues, show off and do whatever you want with this script, it’s all yours ;p.
